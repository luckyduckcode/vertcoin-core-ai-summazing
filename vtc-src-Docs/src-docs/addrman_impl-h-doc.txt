## Explanation of the AddrManImpl Code

This code defines the implementation details of the `AddrMan` class, which manages a list of known Bitcoin addresses. It builds upon the concepts explained in the previous code snippet and provides the concrete functions for various operations.

**1. `AddrInfo` Class:**

* This class extends `CAddress` and holds additional information about an address, including:
    * Last attempt/count attempt time
    * Source of the address knowledge
    * Last successful connection time
    * Connection attempts and failures
    * Reference count in "new" sets
    * Whether it's in the "tried" table
    * Random position in the `vRandom` vector
    * Methods to calculate bucket positions, check if it's "terrible" (based on connection attempts and success), and calculate its selection chance.

**2. `AddrManImpl` Class:**

* This class implements the core functionalities of `AddrMan`.
    * It holds various internal data structures like maps, vectors, and sets to store address information, buckets, and random positions.
    * It uses a mutex (`cs`) to protect concurrent access to these data structures.
    * It defines private member functions (`_*`) that perform the actual work for each public function exposed by `AddrMan`. These private functions acquire the lock (`cs`) before accessing the data structures.
* Public member functions (`*`) of `AddrManImpl` mainly call the corresponding private functions (`_*`) while handling locking and error handling. Here are some key functionalities:
    * **Serialization/Deserialization (`Serialize`, `Unserialize`):** Allows saving and loading the address data from/to a stream.
    * **Size:** Returns the total number of unique addresses in both tables.
    * **Add:** Attempts to add new addresses to the "new" table, considering penalties and reference counts.
    * **Good:** Marks an address as successful and tries to move it to the "tried" table.
    * **Attempt:** Updates information about an address after a connection attempt (success or failure).
    * **ResolveCollisions:** Resolves potential conflicts in the "tried" table.
    * **SelectTriedCollision:** Selects a "tried" address involved in a collision for eviction resolution.
    * **Select:** Chooses an address for connection, optionally from either table.
    * **GetAddr:** Retrieves a random selection of addresses from the list, optionally filtered by network.
    * **Connected:** Updates information about a successfully connected address.
    * **SetServices:** Updates the service bits associated with an address.
    * **GetAsmap:** Returns the AS map (if provided during initialization).
    * **FindAddressEntry (test-only):** Finds an address and returns information about its position in the data structure.
* Additionally, the class defines helper functions for:
    * Finding an address entry by its service information.
    * Creating a new address entry.
    * Swapping elements in the random selection list.
    * Deleting an address entry.
    * Clearing a position in the "new" table (where entries are actually removed).
    * Moving an entry from "new" to "tried" table.
    * Performing consistency checks on the data structures.

**Overall, the `AddrManImpl` class provides the implementation logic for managing the address data, including adding, removing, updating, selecting, and persisting the information.** It ensures thread safety through proper locking and maintains the data structures efficiently for various operations within the `AddrMan` class.
