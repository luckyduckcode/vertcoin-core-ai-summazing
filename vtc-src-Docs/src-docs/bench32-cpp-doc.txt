    Purpose and Copyright:
        The code is related to Bech32 encoding and decoding.
        It is copyrighted by Pieter Wuille (2017, 2021) and The Bitcoin Core developers.

    Bech32 Overview:
        Bech32 is an address format used to pay native SegWit outputs in Bitcoin.
        It separates the witness (signature) data from the rest of the transaction data, making transactions smaller and more efficient.
        Bech32 addresses start with “bc1” and consist of around 42 characters.

    Character Sets:
        CHARSET contains the Bech32 character set used for encoding.
        CHARSET_REV is an array used for decoding Bech32 addresses.

    Finite Field GF(1024):
        The code works with the finite field GF(1024), which is a degree 2 extension of the base field GF(32).
        The defining polynomial of the extension is x^2 + 9x + 23.
        The primitive element (e) generates the field, and every non-zero element can be represented as (e)^k for some power k.
        The arrays GF1024_EXP and GF1024_LOG store powers of (e) and their discrete logarithms, respectively.

    Functionality:
        The code generates the two tables GF1024_EXP and GF1024_LOG as constexpr.
        These tables are used for efficient calculations related to Bech32 encoding and decoding.

Overall, this code sets up the necessary data structures and mathematical tools for working with Bech32 addresses in Bitcoin. It ensures efficient encoding and decoding while maintaining data integrity and security.
