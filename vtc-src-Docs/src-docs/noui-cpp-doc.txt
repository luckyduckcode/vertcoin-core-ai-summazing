This code deals with message handling in a Bitcoin node without a graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a breakdown of its key points:

**1. Purpose:**
   - Provides functions to display messages (error, warning, information) and prompts for user input in a non-GUI environment.
   - Redirects these messages and prompts to the console for logging purposes.

**2. Functions:**
   - `noui_ThreadSafeMessageBox`: Displays a message with a specified style (error, warning, information) and caption.
   - `noui_ThreadSafeQuestion`: Displays a message, caption, and asks the user a question (currently not implemented).
   - `noui_InitMessage`: Logs an initialization message.

**3. Redirection:**
   - The code initially connects to the `uiInterface` signals for message and question handling.
   - `noui_test_redirect` function demonstrates the ability to redirect these messages to the console for logging instead of displaying them.
   - `noui_reconnect` reconnects to the default message handling behavior.

**In summary, this code ensures that essential messages and prompts are displayed or logged even when running a Bitcoin node without a graphical user interface.**
