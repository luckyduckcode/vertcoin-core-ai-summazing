This code defines functions to serialize and deserialize information about banned network entities in Bitcoin. Here's a breakdown of its key points:

**1. CBanEntry:**
   - Represents a single entry in the ban list, containing:
      - Version number of the entry format.
      - Creation time of the ban entry.
      - Time until which the ban is valid.

**2. Serialization (`ToJson`):**
   - Converts a `CBanEntry` object into a JSON object.
   - Includes the version number, creation time, and ban duration in the JSON object.

**3. Deserialization (`BanMapFromJson`):**
   - Converts a JSON array representing banned entries into a `banmap_t` map.
   - Iterates over each JSON object in the array.
   - For each object:
      - Validates the version number.
      - Parses the banned subnet address from the JSON object.
      - Creates a `CBanEntry` object from the parsed information.
      - Adds the entry to the `banmap_t` map using the subnet address as the key.

**In summary, this code provides a mechanism to store and retrieve information about banned IP addresses or subnets in the Bitcoin network.**
