## Code Summary and Functionality

This code provides a set of thread-safe locking mechanisms for the Bitcoin Core project. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

**1. Mutex Protection:**

* It defines various classes like `RecursiveMutex` and `Mutex` that are wrappers around standard C++ mutexes.
* Functions like `LOCK`, `LOCK2`, and `TRY_LOCK` provide a convenient way to acquire and release mutexes with additional features.
* `DebugLock` is used for basic locking with debug information.

**2. Deadlock Prevention:**

* The code utilizes internal data structures to track the order in which threads acquire locks.
* `EnterCritical` checks for potential deadlocks and throws exceptions if a lock is requested in an inconsistent order compared to other held locks.

**3. Double-Locking Detection:**

* It prevents a thread from acquiring the same lock twice consecutively, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
* `AssertLockNotHeld` throws an exception if a thread attempts to acquire a lock it already holds.

**4. Lock Information and Management:**

* Functions like `CheckLastCritical` and `AssertLockHeld` allow checking if a specific lock is currently held by the thread.
* `LeaveCritical` and `DeleteLock` are used to release locks and clean up associated data structures.
* `LocksHeld` returns a string containing information about all locks currently held by the thread.

**5. Thread-local Storage:**

* The code utilizes thread-specific storage to keep track of the lock acquisition order for each thread.

**6. Semaphores:**

* The `CSemaphore` class implements a semaphore object for controlling access to shared resources.
* It allows waiting and signalling operations with thread-safety.
* `CSemaphoreGrant` provides an RAII-style way to manage semaphore grants.

**Overall, this code aims to provide secure and robust locking mechanisms with features to prevent deadlocks, double locking, and offer functionalities for managing lock information and semaphores in a multi-threaded environment.**
