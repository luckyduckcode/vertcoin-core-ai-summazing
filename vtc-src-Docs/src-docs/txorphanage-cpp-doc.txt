## TxOrphanage Code Summary:

This code manages a pool of "orphan transactions" in the Bitcoin network. These are transactions that haven't yet been included in a block because their parent transactions (transactions they reference as inputs) are missing.

**Key functionalities:**

1. **Adding Orphans:**
    - `AddTx`: Adds a transaction to the orphan pool, keeping track of its size, expiration time, and the node that sent it.
    - Ignores transactions exceeding a size limit to prevent memory exhaustion attacks.

2. **Removing Orphans:**
    - `EraseTx`: Removes a specific transaction from the pool by its transaction ID.
    - `EraseForPeer`: Removes all orphans originating from a specific peer.
    - `LimitOrphans`: Evicts enough random orphans to maintain a maximum pool size.
    - `EraseForBlock`: Removes orphans that are included in a block or become invalid due to conflicting transactions in the block.

3. **Tracking Orphans:**
    - Uses various maps and iterators to efficiently track orphans based on transaction ID, witness transaction ID, and their referring outputs (used by other transactions as inputs).
    - Maintains a list of orphans for efficient eviction during pool size limitation.

4. **Finding Orphans:**
    - `HaveTx`: Checks if an orphan with a specific transaction ID or witness transaction ID exists in the pool.
    - `GetTx`: Retrieves the transaction object and originating node ID for a given orphan transaction ID.

5. **Orphan Expiry:**
    - `LimitOrphans`: Regularly checks for expired orphans based on a set expiration time and removes them.

**Overall, this code ensures efficient management of orphan transactions, preventing memory abuse and maintaining consistency with the blockchain state.**
