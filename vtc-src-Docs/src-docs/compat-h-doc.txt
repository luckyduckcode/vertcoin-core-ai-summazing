This code defines compatibility macros and functions between different operating systems. 

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

* **Defines:**
    * Sets platform-specific values for various constants like maximum file path length (`MAX_PATH`) and file permissions (`S_IRUSR`, `S_IWUSR`).
    * Defines missing functions based on platform availability:
        * `strnlen`: calculates the length of a string up to a specific maximum length, used when the standard library might not provide it.
    * Defines platform-specific socket-related functionality:
        * Socket error codes are mapped to their respective values on different platforms (e.g., `WSAEAGAIN` on Windows corresponds to `EWOULDBLOCK` on Linux).
        * `IsSelectableSocket`: checks whether a socket can be used with the `poll` function, considering platform limitations.
        * Defines missing message flags for socket communication (`MSG_NOSIGNAL`, `MSG_DONTWAIT`).

* **Overall Purpose:**
    * This code aims to provide a consistent interface for common functionalities across different operating systems, ensuring the Bitcoin Core software runs smoothly regardless of the underlying platform.
