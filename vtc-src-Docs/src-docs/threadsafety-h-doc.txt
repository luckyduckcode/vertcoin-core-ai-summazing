This code defines the `CThreadInterrupt` class in the Bitcoin Core project. It provides functionalities for:

**1. Thread Interruption:**

* Enables safe interruption of threads that are currently sleeping or waiting.

**2. Triggering Interruption:**

* The `operator()` function sets an internal flag to indicate interruption and notifies all waiting threads.

**3. Checking Interruption:**

* The overloaded `operator bool()` checks the current state of the interrupt flag.

**4. Resetting Interruption:**

* The `reset()` function resets the interrupt flag to its initial state (not interrupted).

**5. Interruptible Sleep:**

* The `sleep_for` functions with different time durations allow a thread to sleep while being interruptible.
* If the thread is interrupted while sleeping, it wakes up and the `sleep_for` function returns `false`.

**Overall, this code provides a mechanism for controlled interruption of threads in the Bitcoin Core project, allowing them to gracefully respond to external events.**

**Note:** This explanation is based on the provided code snippet and might not reflect the entire functionality within the context of the Bitcoin Core project.
