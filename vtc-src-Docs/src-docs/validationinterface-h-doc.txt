This code defines a class named `CValidationInterface` and a global `CMainSignals` object. 

Here's a summary of the key points:

**CValidationInterface:**

* This class defines an interface for objects that want to be notified about various events related to the Bitcoin blockchain. 
* These events include:
    * A new block being added or removed from the blockchain.
    * A transaction being added or removed from the mempool.
    * The state of the blockchain being flushed to disk.
    * The validation state of a block.
    * A new block being received that builds on the current tip.

**CMainSignals:**

* This is a singleton object that serves as a central hub for registering and notifying objects that implement the `CValidationInterface`.
* It provides functions to:
    * Register and unregister objects as subscribers.
    * Signal events to registered subscribers.
    * Manage a queue for callbacks to ensure they are executed in order and safely.

Overall, this code provides a mechanism for different parts of the Bitcoin software to communicate with each other and be notified about changes to the blockchain state.
