This code defines the `ExternalSigner` class and related functionalities for interacting with external signing programs in the Bitcoin Core project.

**Key Points:**

- **`ExternalSigner` class:**
    - Represents an external signer program with properties like command to run, chain it supports, fingerprint, and name.
    - Provides methods for:
        - Enlisting available signers using the `Enumerate` function.
        - Displaying addresses for descriptors using the `DisplayAddress` function.
        - Obtaining transaction descriptors using the `GetDescriptors` function.
        - Signing a partially signed transaction (PSBT) using the `SignTransaction` function.

- **`Enumerate` function:**
    - Takes the command to run, list of existing signers, and chain as input.
    - Calls the external signer's `enumerate` command to get a list of available signers.
    - Parses the response, checks for errors and fingerprints, and avoids duplicates.
    - Creates `ExternalSigner` objects for valid signers and adds them to the provided list.

- **`DisplayAddress` and `GetDescriptors` functions:**
    - Take the signer's fingerprint and network argument as input.
    - Call the external signer's corresponding commands (`displayaddress` and `getdescriptors`) to get the address or descriptors.
    - Use the `RunCommandParseJSON` function to execute the command and parse the JSON response.

- **`SignTransaction` function:**
    - Takes a partially signed transaction (PSBT) and an error string reference as input.
    - Checks if the signer's fingerprint matches any input master key fingerprint in the PSBT.
    - Serializes the PSBT and builds the command to call the external signer's `signtx` command with standard input.
    - Parses the signer's response and checks for errors.
    - Decodes the PSBT returned by the signer and updates the input PSBT if successful.

**Overall:**

This code enables integration with external signing hardware wallets or software programs by providing a standardized interface for communication and signing transactions.
