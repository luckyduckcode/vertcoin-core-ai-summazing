This code defines functionalities related to the **blockchain** in the Bitcoin Core library. It focuses on managing the chain of blocks and navigating within it.

**Key Points:**

* **`CBlockFileInfo`:** This class represents information about a specific portion of the blockchain.
    * It provides details like the number of blocks, total size, and height range within the chain segment.
    * It supports converting this information to a human-readable string format.
* **`CChain`:** This class represents the entire blockchain, essentially a linked list of `CBlockIndex` objects.
    * It supports:
        * Setting the chain tip (the latest block).
        * Retrieving a block locator (a compact representation of the chain for efficient lookups).
        * Finding the fork point (common ancestor) of two blocks in the chain.
        * Finding the earliest block at or after a specific time and/or height.
    * It utilizes the `pskip` pointer in `CBlockIndex` for efficient navigation within the chain, especially for jumping back to previous blocks.
* **`CBlockIndex`:** This class represents a single block in the chain.
    * It stores various data associated with the block, like its hash, height, timestamp, etc.
    * It provides methods for:
        * Getting ancestor blocks at specific heights.
        * Building the `pskip` pointer for faster navigation.
* **`GetBlockProof`:** This function calculates the "proof of work" for a given block, indicating the amount of computational effort invested in mining it.
* **`GetBlockProofEquivalentTime`:** This function calculates the time it would take to mine a block with a specific proof of work, considering the current difficulty and chain state.
* **`LastCommonAncestor`:** This function efficiently finds the last block that is a common ancestor of two given blocks in the chain.

**Overall, this code provides essential functionalities for managing and navigating the blockchain structure in the Bitcoin Core library.**
