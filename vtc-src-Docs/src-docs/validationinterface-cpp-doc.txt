## Summary of the Code

This code defines a class named `CMainSignals` that manages callbacks for various events related to the Bitcoin blockchain. 

Here are the key points:

* **Callbacks:** The code allows different objects to register callbacks to be notified when specific events occur in the blockchain, such as a new block being added or removed, a transaction being added or removed from the mempool, etc.
* **Thread Safety:** The code ensures that callbacks are executed in order and avoids race conditions by using a mutex and a custom queue.
* **Logging:** The code logs information about the events and their associated data before calling the respective callbacks.

This code essentially acts as a central hub for notifying interested parties about various blockchain events and provides a mechanism for them to react accordingly.
