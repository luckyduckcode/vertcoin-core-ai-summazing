## Code Explanation and Functionality Summary

This code defines a class called `CThreadInterrupt` for managing thread interruptions within the Bitcoin Core project. Here's a breakdown of its key functionalities:

**1. Thread Interrupt Flag:**

* It maintains a boolean flag (`flag`) using atomic operations to signal thread interruption.

**2. Interrupt Check:**

* The overloaded `operator bool()` allows checking the current state of the interrupt flag using `std::memory_order_acquire` for thread safety.

**3. Interrupt Reset:**

* The `reset()` function resets the interrupt flag to `false` using `std::memory_order_release` for thread safety.

**4. Interrupt Trigger:**

* The overloaded `operator()` function sets the interrupt flag to `true` using `std::memory_order_release` and notifies all waiting threads using `cond.notify_all()`. This action is protected by a mutex (`mut`) to ensure thread safety.

**5. Interruptible Sleep:**

* The `sleep_for` functions with different time durations (`std::chrono::milliseconds`, `seconds`, and `minutes`) allow a thread to sleep while being interruptible.
* These functions acquire the mutex (`mut`) and wait for the condition variable (`cond`) to be notified. The wait terminates either when the timeout elapses or the interrupt flag becomes `true` (checked with `std::memory_order_acquire`).

**Overall, this code provides a mechanism for threads to safely signal and handle interruptions in a thread-safe manner.**
