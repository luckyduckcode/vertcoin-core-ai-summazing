This code defines functions and functionalities related to message handling for a Bitcoin node running without a graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a summary of its key points:

**1. Non-GUI Message Handlers:**

* **`noui_ThreadSafeMessageBox`:**
    * Displays a message with a specified style (error, warning, information) and caption.
    * Logs the message to the console for non-GUI environments.
* **`noui_ThreadSafeQuestion`:**
    * Intended to display a message, caption, and ask the user a question.
    * Currently not implemented, it logs the message and question to the console instead.
* **`noui_InitMessage`:**
    * Logs an initialization message to the console.

**2. Signal Handling:**

* **`noui_connect`:**
    * Connects the above message handlers to the corresponding signals emitted by the Bitcoin node, ensuring messages are logged or displayed without the GUI.
* **`noui_test_redirect`:**
    * Redirects all message handlers to use `LogPrintf` instead of displaying them.
    * This is useful for testing scenarios where expected errors occur and their output needs to be logged for verification.
* **`noui_reconnect`:**
    * Disconnects the redirected handlers and reconnects the original message handlers after testing.

**In essence, this code provides a mechanism to display or log essential messages and prompts even when running a Bitcoin node without a user interface.**
