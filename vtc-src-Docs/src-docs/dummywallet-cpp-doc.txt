This code defines a dummy implementation of the `WalletInitInterface` class and related functionalities in the Bitcoin Core project, indicating that the build does not include wallet support.

**Key Points:**

- **`DummyWalletInit` class:**
    - Inherits from `WalletInitInterface`.
    - All member functions related to wallet functionality simply return placeholders or throw errors, indicating the lack of support.
    - The `Construct` function logs a message stating that wallet support is not compiled in.
- **`AddWalletOptions` function:**
    - Adds various command-line arguments related to wallet configuration to the `ArgsManager` object.
    - These arguments are marked as hidden as they are not relevant in this build without wallet support.
- **`g_wallet_init_interface`:**
    - A global variable of type `const WalletInitInterface&` initialized with the `DummyWalletInit` instance.
    - This provides a way to reference the dummy implementation for wallet-related functionalities.
- **`MakeWalletLoader` function:**
    - Belongs to the `interfaces` namespace.
    - Throws a `std::logic_error` with the message "Wallet function called in non-wallet build.", indicating that wallet functionalities are not available in this build.

**Overall:**

This code serves two main purposes:

1. **Informs users:** It clearly indicates that the Bitcoin Core build being used does not include wallet support and any attempt to use wallet-related functionalities will result in errors.
2. **Provides a placeholder:** It establishes a dummy implementation for the `WalletInitInterface` and related functions to avoid compilation errors and maintain a consistent code structure, even in builds without wallet support.
