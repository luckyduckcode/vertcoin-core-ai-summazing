This code deals with partially downloaded compact blocks in the Vertcoin blockchain. 

**Key functionalities:**

1. **`CBlockHeaderAndShortTxIDs`:** This class represents a compact block containing:
    * Block header
    * Random nonce
    * Short transaction IDs (computed based on transaction hashes) for most transactions in the block.
    * Optionally, one pre-filled transaction (usually the coinbase).
2. **`PartiallyDownloadedBlock`:** This class represents a partially downloaded block and facilitates its reconstruction:
    * It stores the block header and information about available transaction data.
    * `InitData` function:
        * Validates the compact block and checks if data size is within limits.
        * Initializes the block header and creates an array to store available transactions based on the information in the compact block.
        * Uses the mempool to identify transactions based on their short IDs and stores them in the available transactions array.
        * Checks for potential short ID collisions and invalid data.
    * `IsTxAvailable` function: Checks if a specific transaction at a given index is available in the partially downloaded block.
    * `FillBlock` function:
        * Takes an empty block and a vector of missing transactions as input.
        * Fills the block with available transactions and missing transactions from the provided vector.
        * Performs block validation using the consensus rules.
        * Logs information about the reconstructed block and missing transactions.
        * Clears internal data to prevent further use of the object.

**Overall, this code enables efficient downloading and reconstruction of compact blocks by utilizing short transaction IDs and leveraging the mempool for data retrieval.**
