## Code Explanation and Functionality Summary

This code implements a system for:

**1. Thread-safe locking and deadlock detection:**

* It uses various data structures like `LockData`, `LockStack`, `LockOrders`, and `InvLockOrders` to track acquired locks and their order across different threads.
* Functions like `EnterCritical` are used to acquire a lock (mutex) with deadlock detection. 
* The code ensures that threads acquire locks in a consistent order to prevent deadlocks. 
* If an attempt is made to acquire a lock in an inconsistent order, `potential_deadlock_detected` is thrown, indicating a potential deadlock scenario.

**2. Double lock detection:**

* It prevents a thread from acquiring the same lock twice consecutively, which can lead to undefined behavior.
* `double_lock_detected` is thrown if a thread attempts to acquire the same lock it already holds.

**3. Lock checking and management:**

* Functions like `CheckLastCritical` and `AssertLockHeldInternal` allow checking if a specific lock is currently held by the thread.
* `AssertLockNotHeldInternal` checks if a specific lock is not held by the thread.
* `LeaveCritical` and `DeleteLock` are used to release locks and clean up associated data structures.

**4. Lock information gathering:**

* `LocksHeld` returns a string containing information about all locks currently held by the thread.

**5. Thread-local storage:**

* The code utilizes thread-specific storage to keep track of the lock acquisition order for each thread.

**Overall, this code aims to provide thread-safe locking mechanisms with features to detect and prevent potential deadlocks and double locking issues.**
