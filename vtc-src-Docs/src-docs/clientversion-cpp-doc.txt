This code defines several functions related to generating informative version strings and licensing information for the Bitcoin software.

**Key functionalities:**

* **Client identification:**
    * Defines `CLIENT_NAME` as "Satoshi" to be reported in the version message for both `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt`.
* **Version string generation:**
    * `FormatVersion`: Converts an integer version number to a dotted string format (e.g., "0.21.1").
    * `FormatFullVersion`: Combines the client name, version, and build suffix (e.g., "Satoshi v0.21.1-unk").
* **Subversion string generation:**
    * `FormatSubVersion`: Formats the subversion field according to BIP 14 guidelines, including client name, version, and optional comments.
* **Copyright and license information:**
    * `CopyrightHolders`: Generates a copyright string acknowledging various contributors.
    * `LicenseInfo`: Provides a detailed license and usage information string, including links to the source code and copyright holders.

**In summary, this code provides functions to generate informative strings that identify the Bitcoin software version, copyright holders, and licensing terms.**
