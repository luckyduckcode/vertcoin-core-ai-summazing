This code defines the `FlatFileSeq` class and related functionalities for managing a sequence of flat files in the Bitcoin Core project.

**Key Points:**

- **`FlatFileSeq` class:**
    - Represents a sequence of flat files with a specified prefix, directory, and chunk size.
    - Provides functionalities to:
        - **Open files:** Opens a file at a specific position in read-only or read-write mode.
        - **Allocate space:** Allocates space in the current file or extends it if needed, checking for available disk space.
        - **Flush and finalize:** Flushes the current file to disk and optionally truncates it to the final size.
- **`FlatFilePos` struct:**
    - Represents a position within the sequence, consisting of a file number and an offset within that file.

**Overall:**

This code provides a mechanism for efficiently storing and managing data in a sequence of flat files, ensuring proper allocation, error handling, and flushing to disk. This approach is often used for data like blockchains or transaction logs in Bitcoin Core and similar applications where data grows incrementally and needs to be persisted reliably.
