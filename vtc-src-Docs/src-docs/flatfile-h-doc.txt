This code defines the `FlatFileSeq` class and `FlatFilePos` struct for managing a sequence of flat files in the Bitcoin Core project.

**Key Points:**

- **`FlatFilePos` struct:**
    - Represents a position within the sequence, consisting of a file number and an offset within that file.
    - Provides serialization methods for storing and loading positions.
    - Defines comparison operators and helper functions for setting and checking null positions.

- **`FlatFileSeq` class:**
    - Represents a sequence of flat files with a specified prefix, directory, and chunk size.
    - Provides functionalities to:
        - Construct a `FlatFileSeq` object with the specified parameters.
        - Get the file name for a given position.
        - Open a file at a specific position in read-only or read-write mode.
        - Allocate space in the current file or extend it if needed, checking for available disk space.
        - Flush the current file to disk and optionally truncate it to the final size.

**Overall:**

This code provides a structured approach for working with sequences of flat files. The `FlatFilePos` struct offers a clear way to represent positions within the sequence, while the `FlatFileSeq` class encapsulates the logic for managing file opening, allocation, and flushing, ensuring proper handling of disk space and data persistence.
