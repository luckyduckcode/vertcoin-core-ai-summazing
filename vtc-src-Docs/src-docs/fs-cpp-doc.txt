This code defines the `fsbridge` namespace containing helper functions related to file system operations in the Bitcoin Core project. It specifically addresses platform-specific differences between Windows and non-Windows systems.

**Key Points:**

- **`fopen` function:**
    - A wrapper around the platform-specific `fopen` function, handling UTF-8 encoding for file paths on Windows.

- **`AbsPathJoin` function:**
    - Joins two paths, ensuring the base path is absolute.

- **`FileLock` class:**
    - Represents a file lock on a specific path.
    - Provides platform-specific implementations for acquiring an exclusive lock on the file using `fcntl` on non-Windows and `LockFileEx` on Windows.
    - Handles error reasons for both platforms.

- **`get_filesystem_error_message` function:**
    - Converts a platform-specific file system error message to a UTF-8 string.

**Overall:**

This code provides a cross-platform abstraction layer for file system operations, ensuring consistent behavior and error handling across different operating systems. It helps isolate platform-specific details within the `fsbridge` namespace, promoting cleaner and more portable code in the Bitcoin Core project.
