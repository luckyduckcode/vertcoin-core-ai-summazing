## Summary of the Code:

This code snippet from Bitcoin Core deals with converting Bitcoin data structures into user-friendly formats, specifically focusing on transactions and scripts. Here are the main functionalities:

**1. Amount Conversion:**
   - `ValueFromAmount` converts a Bitcoin amount (in satoshis) to a human-readable string format, including the sign and decimal representation. 

**2. Script Formatting:**
   - `FormatScript` takes a Bitcoin script and converts it into a human-readable string format, displaying the opcodes and data present within the script.

**3. Sighash Conversion:**
   - `SighashToStr` maps an internal sighash type code (used for transaction signing) to its corresponding human-readable string representation.

**4. Script Assembly String Generation:**
   - `ScriptToAsmStr` takes a Bitcoin script and converts it into a human-readable assembly string format, including opcodes, data, and optionally attempts to decode sighash types within the script.

**5. Transaction Serialization:**
   - `EncodeHexTx` serializes a transaction object into its hexadecimal representation, the format used for storing and transmitting transactions on the Bitcoin network.

**6. Script Information Extraction:**
   - `ScriptToUniv` and `ScriptPubKeyToUniv` convert script information (like scriptPubKey) into a JSON object format. This includes script assembly, address (if derivable), and script type.

**7. Transaction Information Extraction:**
   - `TxToUniv` converts a transaction object into a comprehensive JSON object format. This includes details like transaction ID, size, weight, locktime, inputs, outputs, and optionally fees and previous outputs (depending on verbosity settings).

Overall, this code snippet provides various functionalities for processing and presenting Bitcoin data structures in a more user-friendly way, facilitating interaction and analysis of these data structures within the Bitcoin Core software.
